# TicTacToe
This was a coding assignment during a job interview.  The idea was to simulate 2 players playing TicTacToe.
In the game, if a player gets 3 Xs or Os in a row, either across, down or diagonally, that player wins.
There are a few different ways of accomplishing. 
The coding assignment involved using a 2 dimensional array to represent the grid for the game
There are 4 difference cases involved in the game:  across, down, diagonally top to bottom, or diagonally bottom to top.
I chose to create 4 different recursive function, one for each use case.

In this code, I primarily just used PlayerX for most of the moves, with a move by PlayerO thrown in now and then.

Enjoy
